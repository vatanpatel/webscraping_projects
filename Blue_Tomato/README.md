### Task 1
We scrape data for all products from the Snowboard Shop section using Python from blue-tomato.com. We have to gather all products from all genders. The data we want to collect should be for Austria. We want the data in German (language code: DE). We have to make sure that we select the right country and the prices are in Euros (â‚¬).
The output is a .csv file with the following column headers:
- Name: the name or the title of the product
- Brand: the brand name of the product
- Price: the price of the product
- Image Url: the url of the product image
- Product Url: the url of the product page
